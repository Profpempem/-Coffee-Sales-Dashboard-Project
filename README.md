# ☕ Coffee Sales Dashboard Project

## 📝 Project Overview  
This project analyzes 1,000 coffee product orders across multiple countries. Using Excel and an interactive dashboard, I uncover sales trends, customer behavior, and top product insights. The goal is to drive business decisions based on data-driven analysis.

## 🎯 Key Objectives  
- Analyze coffee sales by country, product, and roast type  
- Identify top-performing customers and products  
- Understand customer loyalty and buying behavior  
- Build an interactive dashboard to communicate insights  

## 🔍 Insights & Findings  
- **Top Countries**: United States and Ireland contributed the most to overall sales.  
- **Best-Selling Products**: Robusta and Excelsa blends in medium roast dominated the sales.  
- **Customer Loyalty**: Over 70% of purchases were linked to loyalty card holders.  
- **Sales Trends**: Sales volumes were highest in 2020 and 2021, indicating strong market growth.  

## ✅ Recommendations  
- Focus marketing efforts on high-performing regions (U.S. & Ireland)

- Expand loyalty card benefits to retain and attract more customers  
- Explore product expansion in light roast categories where there's emerging interest
